## üéØ Quick Start

### Monitor the System

```bash
# Check all services healthy
kubectl get pods -n erp

# View recent logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/auth-service -n erp

# Check metrics
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods -n erp

# Access monitoring dashboard
# Application Insights: https://portal.azure.com/
```

## üîç Common Operational Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Service Degradation
```
Alert: Service latency > 500ms
  ‚Üì
Check service metrics (MONITORING.md)
  ‚Üì
Check application logs (LOGGING.md)
  ‚Üì
Scale service (SCALING.md) OR Restart (RUNBOOKS.md)
  ‚Üì
Monitor recovery
  ‚Üì
Post-incident review
```

### Scenario 2: High Error Rate
```
Alert: Error rate > 1%
  ‚Üì
Check error logs (LOGGING.md)
  ‚Üì
Identify affected service
  ‚Üì
Check service health (HEALTH_CHECKS.md)
  ‚Üì
Restart service or rollback
  ‚Üì
Investigate root cause
```

### Scenario 3: Out of Memory
```
Alert: Memory usage > 90%
  ‚Üì
Identify memory leak (MONITORING.md)
  ‚Üì
Increase pod memory limits (SCALING.md)
  ‚Üì
Or scale horizontally (SCALING.md)
  ‚Üì
Update resource limits permanently
  ‚Üì
Monitor memory trends
```
