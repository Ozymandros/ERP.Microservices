## üéì Key Concepts

### 6 Microservices
- **Auth Service** - Authentication & authorization
- **Inventory Service** - Product inventory management
- **Orders Service** - Order processing
- **Sales Service** - Sales management
- **Billing Service** - Billing & invoicing
- **Purchasing Service** - Procurement

### Core Technologies
- **.NET Aspire** - Microservices orchestration
- **DAPR** - Distributed Application Runtime
- **Redis** - Caching & state store
- **SQL Server** - Persistent storage
- **Ocelot** - API Gateway
- **Azure Container Apps** - Production hosting

### Key Patterns
- Service-to-service communication via HTTP & DAPR
- Event-driven architecture with Redis Pub/Sub
- Database per service (polyglot persistence)
- API gateway for external access
- Circuit breaker for resilience
- Health checks for observability

## üí° Common Questions

**Q: How do services communicate?**  
A: Services use HTTP for synchronous calls and DAPR Pub/Sub (Redis) for asynchronous events. See [Microservices Design](MICROSERVICES_DESIGN.md) for details.

**Q: How is data stored?**  
A: Each service has its own database. See [Data Flow](DATA_FLOW.md) for data access patterns.

**Q: What is DAPR?**  
A: DAPR (Distributed Application Runtime) provides cross-platform APIs for building distributed systems. See [ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md).

**Q: How does the API gateway work?**  
A: Ocelot routes all external requests to appropriate services with authentication and rate limiting. See [Gateway Documentation](../api-gateway/README.md).
