# 3. Create resource group
az group create -n erp-rg -l eastus

# 4. Deploy infrastructure
az deployment group create \
  -g erp-rg \
  -f infra/main.bicep \
  -p infra/main.parameters.json

# 5. Deploy services
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/
```

## 🔐 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All tests passing locally
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Secrets in Key Vault (not in code)

## 🆘 Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Deployment timeout | Check resource quotas |
| Authentication failed | Verify credentials |
| Port conflicts | Check existing resources |
| Insufficient quota | Request increase |
| DNS resolution fails | Check DNS settings |
