### Deploy to Azure

```bash
# 1. Authenticate to Azure
az login

# 2. Set subscription
az account set --subscription "subscription-id"

# 3. Create resource group
az group create -n erp-rg -l eastus

# 4. Deploy infrastructure
az deployment group create \
  -g erp-rg \
  -f infra/main.bicep \
  -p infra/main.parameters.json

# 5. Deploy services
kubectl apply -f deploy/kubernetes/
```
