## 🔧 What Was Done

### 10 Issues Fixed (All Critical/High Priority)

**Critical Security (5):**
1. ✅ JWT Bearer Authentication - Gateway was completely open
2. ✅ Rate Limiting - Easy target for DOS attacks
3. ✅ Circuit Breaker - Cascading failures inevitable
4. ✅ Request Tracing - Impossible to debug distributed issues
5. ✅ Claims Propagation - Services couldn't determine user identity

**High-Priority Reliability (5):**
6. ✅ Health Check Routes - No container orchestration support
7. ✅ Port Mapping - Routes didn't work in docker-compose
8. ✅ Notification Service Route - Caused 502 errors
9. ✅ Error Handling - No consistent error responses
10. ✅ Timeout Config - Too long, caused poor UX

## 📋 Configuration Files

### Local Development (ocelot.json)
```
Gateway:    localhost:5000
Services:   localhost:5001-5006
Rate Limit: 100/min
Timeout:    5 seconds
Break:      5 seconds
Auth:       ✅ Required
```

### Production (ocelot.Production.json)
```
Gateway:    https://erp-api.azurewebsites.net
Services:   auth-service, inventory-service, etc.
Rate Limit: 1000/min
Timeout:    10 seconds
Break:      30 seconds
Auth:       ✅ Required
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd ErpApiGateway
dotnet restore
```

### Step 2: Configure JWT
Edit `appsettings.json`:
```json
{
  "JwtSecretKey": "your-secret-key-min-32-characters",
  "JwtIssuer": "http://localhost:5001",
  "JwtAudience": "erp-api",
  "FRONTEND_ORIGIN": "http://localhost:3000"
}
```

### Step 3: Run Gateway
```bash
dotnet run
```

### Step 4: Test
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# With JWT token
curl http://localhost:5000/inventory/items \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] `dotnet restore` completes
- [ ] Project compiles without errors
- [ ] Gateway starts: `dotnet run`
- [ ] Health checks respond:
  - [ ] `/health` → 200 OK
  - [ ] `/health/live` → 200 OK
  - [ ] `/health/ready` → 200 OK
- [ ] Authentication works:
  - [ ] No token → 401 Unauthorized
  - [ ] Valid token → 200 OK
  - [ ] Invalid token → 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Rate limiting works:
  - [ ] 100 requests → Success
  - [ ] 101st request → 429
- [ ] All services accessible through gateway

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- 🔒 Never commit JWT secrets
- 🔒 Use environment variables in production
- 🔒 Rotate keys regularly
- 🔒 Use HTTPS in production

### Performance
- ⚡ Local rate: 100/min (dev speed)
- ⚡ Prod rate: 1000/min (real users)
- ⚡ Adjust timeouts based on perf
- ⚡ Monitor circuit breaker

### Monitoring
- 📊 Watch 401 (auth failures)
- 📊 Watch 429 (rate limit hits)
- 📊 Watch 503 (circuit trips)
- 📊 Correlate with health endpoint
